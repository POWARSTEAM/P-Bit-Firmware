# 🌱 POWAR STEAM – P-Bit Firmware & Dashboard

**P-Bit** is an educational microcontroller developed by [POWAR STEAM SL](https://www.powarsteam.com), designed to teach students about sustainability, climate change, and environmental sensing using hands-on STEAM tools.

This repository contains:

* 🔧 The **firmware** for the P-Bit: sensor readings, BLE communication, and TFT screen display.
* 🧪 A **web-based dashboard**: interactive and kid-friendly interface to visualize live data via Web Bluetooth.

## 🧠 What is the P-Bit?

The P-Bit is a compact environmental data logger equipped with:

* 🌡️ Air temperature and humidity sensors (DHT11 / DS18B20)
* ☀️ Light sensor (LDR)
* 🔊 Sound sensor (analog audio)
* 🌱 Soil temperature and humidity probes
* 🎛️ TFT display + rotary encoder for on-device navigation
* 💡 RGB LED + buzzer for feedback
* 📶 BLE connectivity to send sensor data to a web-based platform

It’s designed to be **used in classrooms** by K-12 students to run experiments, collect real-world data, and explore how environmental factors impact ecosystems and sustainability challenges.
